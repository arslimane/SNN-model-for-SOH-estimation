## ðŸ“– Overview

Lithium-ion battery health monitoring is essential for ensuring safety, reliability, and optimal performance. Conventional SOH estimation methods often require repeated charge/discharge cycles under strictly controlled laboratory conditions, limiting practical applicability.  

This project provides:

1. **A comprehensive LFP battery dataset**:  
   - 19 lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells  
   - Cycle lifetimes: 500â€“2600 cycles  
   - Realistic conditions: **non-constant discharge currents**  
   - Tested at **25Â°C, 35Â°C, and 45Â°C**  

2. **A neuromorphic Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model**:  
   - Mimics biological neurons using **sparse, time-coded spikes**  
   - High temporal precision and **low energy consumption**  
   - Achieves **MAE of 2.61%** for SOH estimation  
   - **Inference time:** 1.09 ms, **Energy consumption:** 0.06 J

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 2.61%  
- **Inference Time:** 1.09 ms  
- **Energy Consumption:** 0.06 J  

The SNN model outperforms conventional deep learning models in computational efficiency while maintaining high predictive accuracy. These characteristics make it particularly suitable for integration into **energy-constrained battery management systems**, supporting both **first-life and second-life applications**.
